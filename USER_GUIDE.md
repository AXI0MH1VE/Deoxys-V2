2. Click **"Encrypt"**
3. The data is encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption
4. Click **"Decrypt"** to recover the original

**Why it's elite:** This is **military-grade privacy**. You can process sensitive data (financial records, medical data, legal documents) without exposing the plaintext.

**Real-world use:**
- Processing confidential financial data
- Medical record analysis
- Legal document review
- Any privacy-critical application

## 🎓 Understanding the Technology

### What is "Zero Entropy Law (C=0)"?

**Entropy** = Uncertainty, randomness, unpredictability

**Zero Entropy** = Complete certainty, no randomness, total predictability

**The Law:** In AxiomHive, the contradiction within any system state must equal zero (C=0). This means:
- No probabilistic operations
- No random number generation (without frozen seeds)
- Complete determinism
- Mathematical verifiability

### What is "State Space Duality"?

Traditional AI uses "attention" - comparing every token to every other token (O(n²)).

AxiomHive uses "State Space Duality" - maintaining a compressed state that evolves linearly (O(n)).

**The Equation:** `h'(t) = Ah(t) + Bx(t)`
- `h(t)` = Current hidden state
- `x(t)` = Input at time t
- `h'(t)` = Next hidden state

This allows processing sequences of any length with constant per-token cost.

### What is "Fully Homomorphic Encryption"?

Normal encryption: Encrypt → Can't process → Decrypt → Process

Homomorphic encryption: Encrypt → Process while encrypted → Decrypt result

**Why it matters:** You can analyze sensitive data (medical records, financial data, legal documents) without ever seeing the plaintext.
